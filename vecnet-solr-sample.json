We evaluated the efficacy of newly developed formulations of larvicides to control Ae. aegypti under field conditions for 24 weeks post single application. Mosdop P and Mosdop TB containing diflubenzuron (2% and 40 mg/tablet, respectively) as the active ingredient, were applied at a dosage of 0.1 mg a.i./1 and Mosquit TB10, Mosquit TB100 and Temecal containing temephos (1%, 10% and 1%, respectively) as the active ingredient were applied at a dosage of 1 mg active ingredent (a.i.) to 200 liter water storage jars. Two water regimens were used in the jars: in one regimen the jar was kept full of water all the time and in the other regimen a full jar had half the volume removed and refilled weekly. The larvicidal efficacy was reported as the level of inhibition of emergence (IE%) calculated based on the pupal skins in the jars versus the original number of larvae added. Mosdop P, Mosdop TB, Mosquit TB10, Mosquit TB100 and Temecal showed complete larvicidal efficacy (100% IE) in the constantly full jars for 16, 17, 14, 20 and 13 weeks posttreatment, respectively; in the jars where half the volum of water was replaced weekly, the larvicides had complete larvicidal efficacy (100% IE) for 19, 20, 17, 24 and 15 weeks post-treatment, respectively. The five larvicide regimens evaluated in this study are effective for controlling Ae. aegypti larvae.",

We use a mathematical model to compare the effectiveness of ITNs and IRS with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or bendiocarb, applied singly and in combination, in an epidemiological setting based in Namawala, Tanzania, with Anopheles gambiae as the primary vector. Our model indicates that although both IRS (with DDT) and ITNs provide personal protection, humans with only ITNs are better protected than those with only IRS, and suggests that high coverage of IRS with bendiocarb may interrupt transmission, as can simultaneous high coverage of ITNs and IRS with DDT. When adding a second vector-control intervention, it is more effective to cover the unprotected population first. Although our model includes some assumptions and approximations that remain to be addressed, these findings should be useful for prioritizing and designing future field research.",

        "dc_description_s": "Various formulations of six insecticides (a carbamate and five pyrethroids), were impregnated into bednets and curtains made from cotton, polyester, polyethylene or polypropylene fabric. For bioassays of insecticidal efficacy, female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were made to walk on the fabrics for 3 min and mortality was scored after 24 h. The main concentrations tested were: bendiocarb 400 mg/m(2), cyfluthrin 30-50 mg/m(2), deltamethrin 15-25 mg/m(2), etofenprox 200 mg/m(2), lambda-cyhalothrin 5-15 mg/m(2) and permethrin 200-500 mg/m(2). Field trials in Tanzania used experimental huts (fitted with verandah traps) entered by wild free-flying Anopheles gambiae, An.funestus and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Results of testing the impregnated fabrics in experimental huts showed better personal protection provided by bednets than by curtains. Permethrin cis:trans isomer ratios 25:75 and 40:60 were equally effective, and the permethrin rate of 200 mg/m(2) performed as well as 500 mg/m(2). Bioassay data emphasized the prolonged insecticidal efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin deposits, except on polyethylene netting. Most of the impregnated nets (including the 'Olyset' net with permethrin incorporated during manufacture of the polyethylene fibre) and an untreated intact net performed well in preventing both Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes from feeding on people using them overnight in the experimental huts. Anopheles showed high mortality rates in response to pyrethroid-treated nets, but only bendiocarb treated curtains killed many Culex. Holed nets treated with either cyfluthrin (5 EW formulation applied at the rate of 50 mg a.i./m(2)) or lambda-cyhalothrin (2.5 CS formulation at 10 mg a.i./m(2)) performed well after 15 months of domestic use. Treatment with deltamethrin SC or lambda-cyhalothrin CS at the very low rate of 3 mg/m(2) gave good results, including after washing and re-treatment.",

        "dc_description_s": "BACKGROUND: In many parts of Africa as in Benin, the main strategies of vector control are based on the scaling-up of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The need to understand the biological implications of IRS in large scale and full coverage of LLITNs is paramount. It is in this context that the present study was conducted. It aims to evaluate the effect of a large scale IRS using a non-pyrethroid insecticide and full coverage of deltamethrin treated nets on the behavior of An. gambiae s.l. in the intervention areas compared to untreated areas used as controls. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected using human landing catches, pyrethrum spray catches and window exit traps to assess reduction of entry rate, endophily rate, endophagy rate and overall mortality rate in natural populations of An. gambiae s.l. before IRS and LLITNs intervention (2007) and after in 2008 and 2010. RESULTS: In the IRS arm, endophily rate was 67.13% before intervention and 4.5% after intervention, whereas in the control arm it was stable at 51.67% (P > 0 .05). In the LLITN arm endophily rates also decreased after intervention. After the IRS, no gravid mosquitoes were collected from all treated localities, but LLITN performance was not that spectacular. The proportion of mosquitoes biting indoors in the IRS arm decreased from 67.09% before intervention to 42.85% after intervention, compared to a low but significant decrease (71.31% to 57. 46%) in the LLITN arm.The use of vector control tools and behavior of the host would be the main factors that modify the behavior of taking a human blood meal observed on An. gambiae s.l. inside human dwellings. CONCLUSION: The impact on the behavior of An. gambiae s.l. observed with the bendiocarb used in IRS was highly effective compared with the free distribution of LLITNs in terms of mortality and the decrease of proportions of indoor feeding. Despite this efficacy, there is a need for complementary tools and research of alternative strategy oriented on effective health education, and the use of powerful tools such as IRS, LLITNs, larviciding and repellents.",

Life expectancy of both males and females of DFB survivors was significantly less in comparison with AZD and CTL ones; however, it was nonsignificantly different between CTL and AZD. In all treatments, males were shorter lived than females of their respective treatments. DFB survivors showed significant reduction in number of blood-fed females, resulting in minimum of oviposition days, total number of egg rafts, total number of eggs, eggs per egg raft, eggs per female life span, and eggs per female per day than survivors of both AZD and CTL significantly, but these parameters did not differ significantly between CTL and AZD, except eggs per egg raft. The net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, and finite rate of increase were significantly less in DFB than rest of the survivors, whereas doubling time for generation was significantly high; however, difference in mean generation was not significant among them. This study reveals that DFB has the potency to affect severely the various life table attributes at sublethal dose, but AZD does not have such effectiveness at similar sublethal dose against Cx. quinquefasciatus.",

Apart from delayed lethal action, possible effects on the reproductive potential were also studied. A baseline concentration of each compound causing 30% emergence inhibition was determined. At this concentration, OMS 2017 affected fecundity of the mosquito but diflubenzuron did not. The fertility of females that survived OMS 2017 exposure also was decreased; 23% of the eggs reached the 4th larval instar. Diflubenzuron did not cause any reduction in fertility. The basal follicle number showed great variability after both treatments as it was alternatively equal, lower, or higher than in the control.",

When larvae were exposed to sublethal concentrations, surviving adults express reduced reproductive potential. In mosquitoes, ecdysteroids are important in larval and adult ovarian development. We applied 30% emergence reduction concentrations (EI30) of OMS 2017 and diflubenzuron to 4th-instar Ae. aegypti to determine if changes in ecdysteroid production may explain these physiological effects. Ecdysteroid concentrations were measured in the larvae, pupae, and adults after treatment with both IGRs. After treatment with OMS 2017, the 1st peak of ecdysteroid production in larvae was totally inhibited, but after pupation, ecdysteroid concentrations were the same as in untreated controls. In diflubenzuron-treated larvae, the second peak of production was delayed and the ecdysteroid concentrations of the larvae, pupae, and adults were depressed slightly when compared with untreated controls. The production of ecdysteroids by the ovaries was not altered by sublethal larval treatment with both IGRs. Although OMS 2017 and diflubenzuron belong to the same chemical family, their mode of action apparently is different.",

However, only a limited number of IGRs have been approved for use in mosquito control. In the present study, two new formulations of the IGR diflubenzuron, 2 per cent granular (GR) and 2 per cent tablet (DT) were tested for its efficacy against Culex quinquefasciatus, in comparison to its 25 per cent wettable powder (WP) formulation. Methods: The WP, GR and DT formulations were tested in cesspits, street drains and abandoned wells each at four dosages, 25, 50, 75 and 100 g ai/ha. Additionally, the DT formulation was tested at a higher dosage of 1 tablet/m(2) (equal to 400 g al/ha). Results: The WP and GR formulations yielded >80 per cent inhibition of adult emergence (IE) for 7-10 days in cesspits, 4-7 days in street drains and 7-21 days in abandoned wells at all dosages tested. The DT formulation was effective only at higher dosage 100 g ai/ha and or 1 tablet/m(2) for 7-15 days at all habitats. Interpretation & conclusions: The trial showed that the dosage 25 g ai/ha of 25 per cent WP could be the field dosage for cesspits and wells, and 50 g al/ha for drains, to be applied at weekly intervals. The dosages 25, 50 and 100 g al/ha of 2 per cent GR could be the field dosages for application in cesspits at weekly intervals, in abandoned wells every three weeks and in drains at weekly intervals, respectively. Diflubenzuron 25 per cent WP and 2 per cent GR could be used for larval control of Cx. quinquefasciatus under integrated vector management programme.",

Selective spraying involved treatment of the vector's preferred indoor resting sites, namely, the lower wall areas, wall areas immediately surrounding the doors and windows, and eaves. Complete spraying involved treatment of all internal wall and ceiling areas, and the eaves. At intervals over a 6-month period, mosquitoes were released into the huts and recaptured within 13 h, either inside the huts, or within the interior of net traps placed over the huts. Mortality levels differed by < 8% between the spray regimens over the posttreatment period, with both regimens giving 75-100% kill of An. flavirostris during the initial 3 months. The time spent spraying and spray volume used during treatment of village houses were respectively 36 and 49% less under the selective spraying regime. Selective application of bendiocarb therefore shows considerable promise, both in terms of efficacy and cost effectiveness, for the control of An. flavirostris in the Philippines.",

        "dc_description_s": "BACKGROUND: Although Anopheles funestus is difficult to rear, it is crucial to analyse field populations of this malaria vector in order to successfully characterise mechanisms of insecticide resistance observed in this species in Africa. In this study we carried out a large-scale field collection and rearing of An. funestus from Mozambique in order to analyse its susceptibility status to insecticides and to broadly characterise the main resistance mechanisms involved in natural populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 3,000 F(1) adults were obtained through larval rearing. WHO susceptibility assays indicated a very high resistance to pyrethroids with no mortality recorded after 1 h 30 min exposure and less than 50% mortality at 3 h 30 min. Resistance to the carbamate, bendiocarb was also noted, with 70% mortality after 1h exposure. In contrast, no DDT resistance was observed, indicating that no kdr-type resistance was involved. The sequencing of the acetylcholinesterase gene indicated the absence of the G119S and F455W mutations associated with carbamate and organophosphate resistance. This could explain the absence of malathion resistance in this population. Both biochemical assays and quantitative PCR implicated up-regulated P450 genes in pyrethroid resistance, with GSTs playing a secondary role. The carbamate resistance observed in this population is probably conferred by the observed altered AChE with esterases also involved. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The high level of pyrethroid resistance in this population despite the cessation of pyrethroid use for IRS in 1999 is a serious concern for resistance management strategies such as rotational use of insecticides. As DDT has now been re-introduced for IRS, susceptibility to DDT needs to be closely monitored to prevent the appearance and spread of resistance to this insecticide.",

        "dc_description_s": "BACKGROUND: To control malaria in Tanzania, two primary vector control interventions are being scaled up: long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The main threat to effective malaria control is the selection of insecticide resistance. While resistance to pyrethroids, the primary insecticide used for LLINs and IRS, has been reported among mosquito vectors in only a few sites in Tanzania, neighbouring East African countries are recording increasing levels of resistance. To monitor the rapidly evolving situation, the resistance status of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.l to different insecticides and the prevalence of the kdr resistance allele involved in pyrethroid resistance were investigated in north-western Tanzania, an area that has been subject to several rounds of pyrethroid IRS since 2006. METHODS: Household collections of anopheline mosquitoes were exposed to diagnostic dosages of pyrethroid, DDT, and bendiocarb using WHO resistance test kits. The relative proportions of An. gambiae s.s and Anopheles arabiensis were also investigated among mosquitoes sampled using indoor CDC light traps. Anophelines were identified to species and the kdr mutation was detected using real time PCR TaqMan assays. RESULTS: From the light trap collections 80% of An. gambiae s.l were identified as An. gambiae s.s and 20% as An. arabiensis. There was cross-resistance between pyrethroids and DDT with mortality no higher than 40% reported in any of the resistance tests. The kdr-eastern variant was present in homozygous form in 97% of An. gambiae s.s but was absent in An. arabiensis. Anopheles gambiae s.s showed reduced susceptibility to the carbamate insecticide, bendiocarb, the proportion surviving WHO tests ranging from 0% to 30% depending on season and location. CONCLUSION: Anopheles gambiae s.s has developed phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids and DDT and kdr frequency has almost reached fixation. Unlike in coastal Tanzania, where the ratio of An. gambiae s.s to An. arabiensis has decreased in response to vector control, An. gambiae s.s persists at high frequency in north-western Tanzania, probably due to selection of pyrethroid resistance, and this trend is likely to arise in other areas as resistance spreads or is subject to local selection from IRS or LLINs.",

Indoor resting densities of fed Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus in intervention houses were 58.5% (P = 0.010) and 94.5% (P = 0.001) lower, respectively, compared with control houses. The sporozoite infection rate in An. gambiae s.l. was 0.8% in intervention areas compared with 3.4% (P = 0.026) in control areas, while the sporozoite infection rates in An. funestus were not significantly different between the two areas. We estimated the overall transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in intervention areas to be 90% lower than in control areas. Permethrin resistance was not detected during the study period. As measured by densities of An. gambiae s.l., the efficacy of bed nets decreased if one or more residents did not sleep under a net or if bed nets had not been re-treated within six months. These results indicate that ITNs are optimally effective if used every night and if permethrin is reapplied at least biannually.",

The control village was sprayed with malathion at 1 g/m2 in 2001. Two rounds of bendiocarb spraying were carried out in each year from 1999 to 2001. Bendiocarb applications resulted in significant reduction in densities of adult An. culicifacies and other mosquito species in villages when compared to that of the control village (P < 0.05). Bioassay tests revealed that persistence of insecticide against An. culicifacies at 100% mortality was observed for about 10, 8, and 10 wk on mud, cement, and brick wall surfaces, respectively. Epidemiological evaluation revealed that malaria cases were significantly reduced after 1 year of spraying (P < 0.05) and by 2001, no Plasmodium falciparum was recorded in either of the bendiocarb-sprayed villages. The study revealed that indoor residual spraying of bendiocarb 80% WP at 0.2 g/m2 produced effective control of resistant An. culicifacies, provided that >95% human-dwelling room coverage is achieved in both 1st and 2nd rounds of spraying at an interval of 10 wk in areas where malaria is a seasonal problem.",

This longitudinal study demonstrates the trends in malaria vector dynamics and their relative contribution to malaria transmission in hyperendemic transmission settings in Tanzania. Methods: The study was conducted in two villages within the Kilombero Valley, in rural Tanzania for five consecutive years (2008-2012). Seventy-two houses were selected per village and each house was sampled for mosquitoes monthly using a CDC light trap. Collected mosquitoes were assessed for species identity and sporozoite infection status using PCR and ELISA, respectively. Anopheles funestus and Anopheles arabiensis susceptibility to insecticides was assessed using WHO guidelines. Results: A total of 100,810 malaria vectors were collected, of which 76% were Anopheles gambiae s. l. and 24% were An. funestus. Of all An. funestus samples that amplified with PCR (n = 2,737), 97% were An. funestus s.s., 2% were Anopheles rivorulum and 1% Anopheles leesoni. Whereas for An. gambiae s. l. (n = 8,117), 93% were An. arabiensis and 7% were Anopheles gambiae s. s. The proportion of An. gambiae s. s. identified by PCR (2,924) declined from 0.2% in the year 2008 to undetectable levels in 2012. Malaria transmission intensity significantly decreased from an EIR of 78.14 infectious bites/person/year in 2008 to 35 ib/p/yr in 2011 but rebounded to 226 ib/p/yr in 2012 coinciding with an increased role of An. funestus in malaria transmission. Insecticide susceptibility tests indicated high levels of resistance in An. funestus against deltamethrin (87%), permethrin (65%), lambda cyhalothrin (74%), bendiocarb (65%), and DDT (66%). Similarly, An. arabiensis showed insecticide resistance to deltamethrin (64%), permethrin (77%) and lambda cyhalothrin (42%) in 2014. Conclusion: The results indicate the continuing role of An. arabiensis and the increasing importance of An. funestus in malaria transmission, and pyrethroid resistance development in both species. Complementary vector control and surveillance tools are needed that target the ecology, behaviour and insecticide resistance management of these vector species, in order to preserve the efficacy of LLINs.",

South Africa experienced a severe malaria epidemic during 1999/2000 due to pyrethroid resistance in the major vector Anopheles funestus. Subsequent monitoring and surveillance of mosquito populations were conducted as part of the malaria vector control programme. METHODS: A sample of 269 Anopheles funestus s.l. was collected in Mamfene, northern KwaZulu-Natal, using exit window traps in pyrethroid sprayed houses between May and June 2005. Mosquitoes were identified to species level, assayed for insecticide susceptibility, analysed for Plasmodium falciparum infectivity and blood meal source. RESULTS: Of the 220 mosquitoes identified using the rDNA PCR method, two (0.9%) were An. funestus s.s. and 218 (99.1%) Anopheles parensis. Standard WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were performed on F1 progeny from wild caught An. parensis females and a significant survival 24 h post exposure was detected in 40% of families exposed to 0.05% deltamethrin. Biochemical analysis of F1 An. parensis showed no elevation in levels/activity of the detoxifying enzyme systems when compared with an insecticide susceptible An. funestus laboratory strain. Among the 149 female An. parensis tested for P. falciparum circumsporozoite infections, 13.4% were positive. All ELISA positive specimens (n = 20) were re-examined for P. falciparum infections using a PCR assay and none were found to be positive. Direct ELISA analysis of 169 blood meal positive specimens showed > 75% of blood meals were taken from animals. All blood fed, false positive mosquito samples for the detection of sporozoites of P. falciparum were zoophilic. CONCLUSION: The combination of pyrethroid resistance and P. falciparum false-positivity in An. parensis poses a problem for vector control. If accurate species identification had not been carried out, scarce resources would have been wasted in the unnecessary changing of control strategies to combat a non-vector species.",

Clade I is common across the continent while clade II is known only from Mozambique and Madagascar. The specific biological status of these clades is at present unknown. We investigated the possible role that each clade might play in the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and the insecticide resistance status of An. funestus from Zimbabwe and Zambia.MethodsMosquitoes were collected inside houses from Nchelenge District, Zambia and Honde Valley, Zimbabwe in 2013 and 2014. WHO susceptibility tests, synergist assays and resistance intensity tests were conducted on wild females and progeny of wild females. ELISA was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein. Specimens were identified to species and mtDNA clades using standard molecular methods.ResultsThe Zimbabwean samples were all clade I while the Zambian population comprised 80% clade I and 20% clade II in both years of collection. ELISA tests gave an overall infection rate of 2.3% and 2.1% in 2013, and 3.5% and 9.2% in 2014 for Zimbabwe and Zambia respectively. No significant difference was observed between the clades. All populations were resistant to pyrethroids and carbamates but susceptible to organochlorines and organophosphates. Synergist assays indicated that pyrethroid resistance is mediated by cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases. Resistance intensity tests showed high survival rates after 8-hrs continuous exposure to pyrethroids but exposure to bendiocarb gave the same results as the susceptible control.ConclusionsThis is the first record of An. funestus mtDNA clade II occurring in Zambia. No evidence was found to suggest that the clades are markers of biologically separate populations. The ability of An. funestus to withstand prolonged exposure to pyrethroids has serious implications for the use of these insecticides, either through LLINs or IRS, in southern Africa in general and resistance management strategies should be urgently implemented.",

        "dc_description_s": "Malaria control in the southern part of Mozambique is currently by indoor residual spraying with a carbamate insecticide and by pyrethroid-treated bed-nets distributed to pregnant women and children under five in northern Mozambique. The susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis Patton to pyrethroid, carbamate, organochlorine, and organophosphorus insecticides was determined by World Health Organization adult mosquito susceptibility tests at 17 localities in Mozambique, from March 2000 to July 2002. Biochemical assays were carried out on mosquitoes from the same families to detect shifts in the quantity or activity of enzyme families involved in insecticide detoxification. An. gambiae s.s. from all localities remained fully susceptible to DDT and the organophosphorus insecticide malathion. A low level of pyrethroid resistance was detected in populations in southern Mozambique. Populations outside Maputo province were still susceptible to pyrethroids. Low level resistance to the carbamate propoxur also was detected in An. arabiensis from two localities. Mosquitoes from five of the localities had elevated p450 estimates, compared with the insecticide susceptible Durban strain. The lack of cross-resistance between pyrethroids and DDT in Mozambican populations suggests that a kdr-type target site resistance mechanism has not been selected. Increased frequencies of insecticide insensitive acetylcholinesterase, the target site for carbamates and organophosphates, were found in 16 of the populations tested. Although vector control with bendiocarb is not being compromised by the presence of the acetylcholinesterase mechanism alone, the high level of insensitive acetylcholinesterase unless sensibly managed may have long-term implications for malaria control programs in Mozambique.",

Monitoring insecticide resistance in the main Sudanese malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis, is essential for planning and implementing an effective vector control program in this country. Methods: WHO susceptibility tests were used to monitor resistance to insecticides from all four WHO-approved classes of insecticide at four sentinel sites in Gezira state over a three year period. Insecticide resistance mechanisms were studied using PCR and microarray analyses. Results: WHO susceptibility tests showed that Anopheles arabiensis from all sites were fully susceptible to bendiocarb and fenitrothion for the duration of the study (2008-2011). However, resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was detected at three sites, with strong seasonal variations evident at all sites. The 1014 F kdr allele was significantly associated with resistance to pyrethroids and DDT (P < 0.001) with extremely high effects sizes (OR > 7 in allelic tests). The 1014S allele was not detected in any of the populations tested. Microarray analysis of the permethrin-resistant population of An. arabiensis from Wad Medani identified a number of metabolic genes that were significantly over-transcribed in the field-collected resistant samples when compared to the susceptible Sudanese An. arabiensis Dongola strain. These included CYP6M2 and CYP6P3, two genes previously implicated in pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s, and the epsilon-class glutathione-S-transferase, GSTe4. Conclusions: These data suggest that both target-site mechanisms and metabolic mechanisms play an important role in conferring pyrethroid resistance in An. arabiensis from Sudan. Identification in An. arabiensis of candidate loci that have been implicated in the resistance phenotype in An. gambiae requires further investigation to confirm the role of these genes.",

Among Þve insecticides tested, obvious reduced susceptibilities were observed for etofenprox, which is the only pyrethroid compound registered as a larvicide in Japan. Twenty-two of 56 colonies exhibited a �10% survival rate at the etofenprox concentration of 5.7 �g/ml, which is a 10 times higher concentration of the working solution. The LC50 of a colony collected from Fukuoka prefecture for etofenprox exceeded 60 �g/ml (resistance ratio �2,307), and this colony also exhibited cross-resistance to other pyrethroids, permethrin (299-fold) and phenothrin (1,200-fold). The insect growth regulators dißubenzuron and pyriproxyfen were found to be sufÞciently effective enough to control Culex larvae present, but decreased sensitivities to these insecticides were slightly detected in some colonies of Cx. p. form molestus collected from urban areas.

Comparisons between the unselected base colony and the DDT-resistant strain showed elevated glutathione-S-transferase (P<0.05) in both sexes and elevated esterases (P<0.05) in males only. The Leu-Phe mutation in the sodium channel gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, but showed no correlation with the resistant phenotype. These results do not provide any explanation as to why this colony exhibits such widespread resistance and further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanisms involved. The implications for malaria vector control in central Sudan are serious and resistance management (e.g. through the rotational use of different classes of insecticides) is recommended.",

Only An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis ( approximately 70%) were present. Female An. gambiae exhibited extremely high pyrethroid resistance (permethrin LT50 > 2 h; deltamethrin LT50 > 5 h). Female An. arabiensis were resistant to permethrin and exhibited reduced susceptibility to deltamethrin. However, while An. gambiae were DDT resistant, An. arabiensis were fully susceptible. Both species were fully susceptible to bendiocarb and fenitrothion. Kdr 1014S has increased rapidly in the Jinja population of An. gambiae s.s. and now approaches fixation ( approximately 95%), consistent with insecticide-mediated selection, but is currently at a low frequency in An. arabiensis (0.07%). Kdr 1014F was also at a low frequency in An. gambiae. These frequencies preclude adequately-powered tests for an association with phenotypic resistance. PBO synergist bioassays resulted in near complete recovery of pyrethroid susceptibility suggesting involvement of CYP450s in resistance. A small number (0.22%) of An. gambiae s.s. xAn. arabiensis hybrids were found, suggesting the possibility of introgression of resistance alleles between species. The high levels of pyrethroid resistance encountered in Jinja threaten to reduce the efficacy of vector control programmes which rely on pyrethroid-impregnated bednets or indoor spraying of pyrethroids.",

Laboratory evaluation of two insect growth regulators, Diflubenzuron and Buprofezin 25% WP (wettable powder), chitin synthesis inhibitors, was carried out against Aedes aegypti (early 4(th) instars) larvae collected from natural containers (used tiers and plastic jars) at Lahore Pakistan. The primary objective was to determine the minimum effective dosage of each for larval mortality along with pupae reduction and adult emergence inhibition (El). Laboratory bioassays with Buprofezin indicated LC50-LC95 ranged 0.341-2.54ppm at 48h post exposure. Pupae formation was completely inhibited at 48h and 120h post exposure against 10 and 1 ppm respectively while 80% pupae reduction was observed against 0.0001ppm one week post exposure. No adults emerged against upto 1ppm, and 96% adult emergence was inhibited against 0.1ppm one week post exposure. In contrast LC50-LC95 ranged 29-83ppm at 48h post exposure against Diflubenzuron indicated less effect at larval stages as compared to Buprofezin. Maximum pupae inhibition (100%) and adult emergence inhibition (El) was observed against 1 ppm and 0.1ppm diflubenzuron respectively at one week post exposure. Results indicated buprofezin cause high larval mortality while the effect of diflubenzuron was more toxic to pupae and adults emergence. Further studies in natural conditions are in progress to control dengue vectors in Pakistan.",

By 2001-03, following high usage rates (75% of all age groups) of untreated bed nets, a 4.2-fold reduction in malaria transmission intensity was achieved. Since 2006, a national-scale programme has promoted the use of longer-lasting insecticide treatment kits (consisting of an insecticide plus binder) co-packaged with all bed nets manufactured in the country.\nMethods\nThe entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was estimated through monthly surveys in 72 houses randomly selected in each of the two villages. Mosquitoes were caught using CDC light traps placed beside occupied bed nets between January and December 2008 (n = 1,648 trap nights). Sub-samples of mosquitoes were taken from each trap to determine parity status, sporozoite infection and Anopheles gambiae complex sibling species identity.\nResults\nCompared with a historical mean EIR of ~1400 infectious bites/person/year (ib/p/y) in 1990-94; the 2008 estimate of 81 ib/p/y represents an 18-fold reduction for an unprotected person without a net. The combined impact of longer-lasting insecticide treatments as well as high bed net coverage was associated with a 4.6-fold reduction in EIR, on top of the impact from the use of untreated nets alone. The scale-up of bed nets and subsequent insecticidal treatment has reduced the density of the anthropophagic, endophagic primary vector species, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, by 79%. In contrast, the reduction in density of the zoophagic, exophagic sibling species Anopheles arabiensis was only 38%.\nConclusion\nInsecticide treatment of nets reduced the intensity of malaria transmission in addition to that achieved by the untreated nets alone. Impacts were most pronounced against the highly anthropophagic, endophagic primary vector, leading to a shift in the sibling species composition of the A. gambiae complex.",

This study reports results of the first nation-wide assessment of insecticide susceptibility in wild populations of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in Zimbabwe, and provides a comprehensive review of the insecticide resistance status of An. gambiae s.l. in southern African countries. METHODS: World Health Organization (WHO) insecticide susceptibility tests were performed on 2,568 field collected mosquitoes originating from 13 sentinel sites covering all endemic regions in Zimbabwe in 2011-2012. At each site, 24-hour mortality and knock-down values for 50% and 90% of exposed mosquitoes (KD50 and KD90, respectively) were calculated for pools of 20-84 (mean, 54) mosquitoes exposed to 4% DDT, 0.1% bendiocarb, 0.05% lambda-cyhalothrin or 5% malathion. Susceptibility results from Zimbabwe were compiled with results published during 2002-2012 for all southern African countries to investigate the resistance status of An. gambiae s.l. in the region. RESULTS: Using WHO criteria, insecticide resistance was not detected at any site sampled and for any of the insecticide formulations tested during the malaria transmission season in 2012. Knock-down within 1 hr post-insecticide exposure ranged from 95% to 100%; mortality 24 hours post-insecticide exposure ranged from 98% to 100%. Despite the lack of insecticide resistance, high variability was found across sites in KD50 and KD90 values. A total of 24 out of 64 (37.5%) sites in southern Africa with reported data had evidence of phenotypic insecticide resistance in An. gambiae s.l. to at least one insecticide. CONCLUSION: Despite a long history of indoor residual spraying of households with insecticide, up to 2012 there was no evidence of phenotypic resistance to any of the four insecticide classes in An. gambiae s.l. collected across different eco-epidemiological areas in Zimbabwe. Results reinforce the need for careful monitoring over time in sentinel sites in order to detect the potential emergence and propagation of insecticide resistance as insecticidal vector control interventions in Zimbabwe continue to be implemented.",

Human plasma specimens obtained from suspected patients and adult wild-caught mosquitoes were detected for chikungunya virus employing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique. Chikungunya virus was detected in about half of the blood specimens whereas a range of 5.5 to 100% relative infection rate was found in both sexes of the vector mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus Skuse. The infection rate in Ae. albopictus was higher than in Ae. aegypti, with relative infection rate in male of both species being higher than in female. The appearance of chikungunya virus in adult male mosquitoes of both species reveals a role of transovarial transmission of the virus in field population of the mosquito vectors. These findings have provided further understanding of the relationship among mosquito vectors, chikungunya virus and epidemiology of chikungunya fever in Thailand.",

(Diptera: Culicidae) population in Bungoma District, a region in western Kenya in which malaria is endemic and rates of ownership of insecticide-treated bednets are high. The sensitivity of individual An. gambiae s.l. females as indicated in assays using World Health Organization (WHO) test kits demonstrated reduced mortality in response to permethrin, deltamethrin and bendiocarb. Estimated time to knock-down of 50% (KDT50 ) of the test population in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) bottle bioassays was significantly lengthened for the three insecticides compared with that in a susceptible control strain. Anopheles arabiensis from all three sites showed higher mortality to all three insecticides in the WHO susceptibility assays compared with the CDC bottle assays, in which they showed less sensitivity and longer KDT50 than the reference strain for permethrin and deltamethrin. Microplate assays revealed elevated activity of beta-esterases and oxidases, but not glutathione-S-transferase, in An. gambiae s.s. survivors exposed to permethrin in bottle bioassays compared with knocked down and unexposed individuals. No An. arabiensis showed elevated enzyme activity. The 1014S kdr allele was fixed in the Bungoma An. gambiae s.s. population and absent from An. arabiensis, whereas the 1014F kdr allele was absent from all samples of both species. Insecticide resistance could compromise vector control in Bungoma and could spread to other areas as coverage with longlasting insecticide-treated bednets increases.",

Each formulation was applied to 200-1 clay jars at 5 different dosages (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/l a.i.). The jars were covered with solid celocrete sheets and placed in the shade under a roof. Another experiment was also carried out using 3 different dosages (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/l) where half the water in each treated jar and the control was removed and refilled weekly. Each treatment was replicated four times. The treatments were challenged by adding 25 3rd instar larvae/jar weekly. Assessments were made of each treatment through emergence inhibition (%EI) by removing and counting pupal skins one week after larval addition. Using these assessment techniques, a high degree of larvicidal efficacy (96-100%EI) was achieved with 4 dosages (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/l) of both (tablet and granular) formulations for a period of 23 weeks post-treatment. The efficacy of the lowest dosage (0.02 mg/l) of tablet and granular formulations lasted for 21 and 22 weeks post-treatment, respectively. Under the conditions of water removal and weekly refilling, a high degree of larvicidal efficacy (96-100%El) at the 3 dosages was obtained with the tablet formulation 18 to 21 weeks post-treatment, whereas the efficacy of the granular formulation persisted 15 to 23 weeks post-treatment depending on the dosage. This study clearly demonstrates a high level of residual activity with both formulations of diflubenzuron against larvae of Ae. aegypti in water-storage containers. Considering environmental factors and water-use conditions, it is likely that dosages of 0.05 to 0.1 mg a.i./l are effective dosages providing long-lasting control for 3 to 4 months in the field.",

METHODS: Larvae and pupae of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were collected from the breeding sites in Seme-Kpodji and Cotonou districts in Southern Benin in April 2013 during the first rainy season. Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were also collected from the breeding sites in Parakou district in Northern Benin in May 2013 at the beginning of the rainy season. Susceptibility tests were done using impregnated paper with bendiocarb (0.1%) following WHO protocol and stock solutions of permethrin (21.5 microg per bottle) and deltamethrin (12.5 microg per bottle) following CDC protocol on unfed female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days old. These bioassays were repeated a certain number of times. The temperature and relative humidity were monitored and recorded during the susceptibility tests. RESULTS: This study showed that a WHO impregnated paper with bendiocarb could be used four times during four consecutive days in field conditions. Regarding a Wheaton coated bottle with permethrin or deltamethrin, they could be used at least three times during four consecutive days in laboratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The day storage and the number of times that a WHO impregnated paper and a CDC coated bottle maintained their efficacy are useful in the assessment of insecticide vectors susceptibility tests.",

        "dc_description_s": "The success of malaria eradication campaigns depends on the use of all methods that make for a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of mosquito vectors. One such method is precipitin testing, by which it is possible to identify the human or animal origin of blood-meals of mosquitos and thereby to determine their host preferences and vectorial importance, both generally and locally.In 1955 the World Health Organization, in agreement with the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, Elstree, England, set up a precipitin test service available to national research institutions and field staff of malaria eradication projects. The results of the tests carried out in 1959-64 are now presented in summary form; the data were obtained from nearly 41 000 blood smears collected from 79 species of Anopheles. In addition, the previously published results of the 1955-59 period are retabulated and data are presented on nearly 27 000 tests carried out independently at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi, India, on Anopheles from Ceylon, India and Nepal. Altogether the review covers some 124 000 precipitin tests on 92 Anopheles species; about 93% of the tests gave a positive result with one or other of the antisera used, but attention is chiefly paid to the proportion of blood-meals taken on man.There are practical difficulties in achieving representative sampling of Anopheles populations for determination of the human blood index, but some can be overcome by increased care in sampling from a representative selection of biotopes. In areas that have been sprayed with insecticide, an attempt should be made to include mosquitos knocked down by the insecticide after feeding.",

The vectorial capacity and the reproduction rates of malaria vary as the square of the proportion of blood meals obtained, from the human host. This proportion, known as the human blood index, is usually estimated by the precipitin test technique. A precipitin test service available to national research institutions and field staff of malaria eradication projects was set up by the World Health Organization in 1955 under agreement with the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, Elstree, United Kingdom. Its continuing work is periodically reported. The results of the tests carried out over the period 1959-1964 are now presented in the second summary which comprises the data on nearly 41 000 blood smears collected on 79 species of Anopheles. In addition the results from the first summary, covering the period 1955-1959, are retabulated, and data on nearly 27 000 precipitin tests carried out independently on Anopheles from Ceylon, India and Nepal at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (Dellli, India) are presented. Altogether the present review covers more than 124 000 precipitin tests carried out on 92 Anopheles species - the largest study of this kind ever undertaken. About 94% of these tests gave positive results with one or another of the antisera used, but the main attention has been paid to the proportion of blood meals taken on man. While precipitin testing of good samples provides a criterion of host selection by the vector, a complementary technique to assess its host preference under controlled conditions exists, and deserves wide application. A design is suggested for combined operational studies of the vectors' feeding habits, prior to and under attack, in technically difficult areas. There are practical difficulties in achieving representative sampling of Anopheles populations for the human blood index, but some of these can be overcome by judicious designing of the patterns of collection and attention to searches in a representative selection of biotopes. In sprayed areas an attempt should be made to include mosquitos knocked down by the insecticide after feeding. The epidemiological importance of the human blood index is discussed with regard to current malaria eradication programmes. There is some evidence of changes of host selection in populations of certain Anopheles species in areas where residual insecticides are used on a large scale. The mechanism of the apparent changes of behaviour in malaria vectors is not fully known; any that reduce the human blood index must decrease the transmission of malaria and be a positive factor in achieving eradication.",

        "dc_description_s": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: A longitudinal Anopheles gambiae s.l. insecticide-resistance monitoring programme was established in four sentinel sites in Burkina Faso. For three years, between 2008 and 2010, WHO diagnostic dose assays were used to measure the prevalence of resistance to all the major classes of insecticides at the beginning and end of the malaria transmission season. Species identification and genotyping for target site mutations was also performed and the sporozoite rate in adults determined. RESULTS: At the onset of the study, resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was already prevalent in An. gambiae s.l. from the south-west of the country but mosquitoes from the two sites in central Burkina Faso were largely susceptible. Within three years, DDT and permethrin resistance was established in all four sites. Carbamate and organophosphate resistance remains relatively rare and largely confined to the south-western areas although a small number of bendiocarb survivors were found in all sites by the final round of monitoring. The ace-1R target site resistance allele was present in all localities and its frequency exceeded 20% in 2010 in two of the sites. The frequency of the 1014F kdr mutation increased throughout the three years and by 2010, the frequency of 1014F in all sites combined was 0.02 in Anopheles arabiensis, 0.56 in An. gambiae M form and 0.96 in An. gambiae S form. This frequency did not differ significantly between the sites. The 1014S kdr allele was only found in An. arabiensis but its frequency increased significantly throughout the study (P = 0.0003) and in 2010 the 1014S allele frequency was 0.08 in An. arabiensis. Maximum sporozoite rates (12%) were observed in Soumousso in 2009 and the difference between sites is significant for each year. CONCLUSION: Pyrethroid and DDT resistance is now established in An. gambiae s.l. throughout Burkina Faso. Results from diagnostic dose assays are highly variable within and between rounds of testing, and hence it is important that resistance monitoring is carried out on more than one occasion before decisions on insecticide procurement for vector control are made. The presence of 1014S in An. gambiae s.l., in addition to 1014F, is not unexpected given the recent report of 1014S in Benin but highlights the importance of monitoring for both mutations throughout the continent. Future research must now focus on the impact that this resistance is having on malaria control in Burkina Faso.",

        "dc_description_s": "BACKGROUND: The dual problems of rising insecticide resistance in the malaria vectors and increasing human malaria cases since 2001 in southern Mozambique are cause for serious concern. The selection of insecticides for use in indoor residual spraying (IRS) programmes is highly dependent on the extent to which local mosquitoes are susceptible to the approved classes of insecticides. The insecticide resistance status and role in malaria transmission of Anopheles funestus was evaluated at the Maragra Sugar Estate in southern Mozambique where an IRS vector control programme has been in operation for seven years using the carbamate insecticide bendiocarb. RESULTS: No Anopheles species were captured inside the sugar estate control area. Anopheles funestus group captured outside of the estate represented 90% (n = 475) of the total collections. Of the specimens identified to species by PCR (n = 167), 95% were An. funestus s.s. One An. rivulorum was identified and seven specimens did not amplify. The Anopheles gambiae complex was less abundant (n = 53) and of those identified (n = 33) 76% were An. arabiensis and 24% An. merus. Insecticide susceptibility tests showed that wild-caught and F-1 family An. funestus were resistant to deltamethrin (32.5% mortality) and lambda-cyhalothrin (14.6% mortality), less so to bendiocarb (71.5% mortality) and fully susceptible to both malathion and DDT (100%). Bendiocarb and pyrethroid resistance was nullified using 4% piperonyl butoxide (Pbo), strongly suggesting that both are mediated by P450 monooxygenase detoxification. ELISA tests of An. funestus for Plasmodium falciparum, gave a sporozoite rate of 6.02% (n = 166). One unidentified member of the An. gambiae complex tested positive for P. falciparum sporozoites. CONCLUSION: Anopheles funestus was found to be the most abundant and principle vector of malaria in this area, with members of the An. gambiae complex being secondary vectors. Despite the continual use of bendiocarb within the estate for seven years and the level of An. funestus resistance to this insecticide, the IVC programme is still effective against this and other Anopheles in that no vectors were found inside the control area. However, the Mozambique National Malaria Control Programme ceased the use of DDT and bendiocarb in this area of its operations in 2009, and replaced these insecticides with a pyrethroid which will increase insecticide resistance selection pressure and impact on control programmes such as the Maragra IVC.",
